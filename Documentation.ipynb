    "## What is Fisher's Iris Dataset?\n",
    "The Fisher's Iris dataset is a simple dataset of 150 records: 50 records of 3 different types of irises. There are 5 variables in the dataset:\n",
    "1. sepal length in cm\n",
    "2. sepal width in cm\n",
    "3. petal length in cm\n",
    "4. petal width in cm\n",
    "5. class:\n",
    "-- Iris Setosa\n",
    "-- Iris Versicolour\n",
    "-- Iris Virginica\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected by Edgar Anderson who was trying to work out how one species of Iris evolved from another. He chose to study Iris Versicolour, but subsequently discovered this was actually two species: Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. He added to his investigation Iris Setosa. From his investigation he discovered that the Iris Versicolour in North East America as a breeding of Iris Viginica and Irish Setosa.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was published by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems [1]. From analysing the data Fisher showed that Iris Setosa could be separated from Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. Through this project we are going to use Python to create some visual representations of the data that confirms this differentiation. The data set was donated in 1988 by Michael Marshall and is published to the public at UCI Machine Learning Repository [2]. "
